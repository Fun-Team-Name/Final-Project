# **Vision Statement**

## **Our Goal**

Elementary school students have to spend a lot of time memorizing multiplication and division facts.  Traditional methods such as flashcards and timed worksheets feel tedious to children with already short attention spans, damaging overall math interest.  Previous gamification attempts frequently add bright and colorful tedium without fixing the underlying problem.  We seek to offer a streamlined game that alleviates tedium with the well proven incentive of competition.


## **Our Product**

Our product will consist of a web-based application that allows a teacher to to create an isolated environment for just their class or grade.  Students can then log in and are sorted into rooms by skill level where they "battle" by quickly and correctly answering multiplication, division, addition, and/or subtraction.  Our software then keeps metrics on each students skill that the teacher can access.  This takes grading pressure off of the teacher while increasing accuracy compared to paper systems as well as reduce environmental cost.
