# **Vision Statement**

## **Our Goal**

Elementary school students have to spend a lot of time memorizing multiplication and division facts.  Traditional methods such as flashcards and timed worksheets feel tedious to children with already short attention spans, damaging overall math interest.  Previous gamification attempts frequently add bright and colorful tedium without fixing the underlying problem.  We seek to offer a streamlined game that alleviates tedium with the well proven incentive of competition.


## **Our Product**

Our product will consist of a web-based application that allows a teacher to to create an isolated environment for just their class or grade.  Students can then log in and are sorted into rooms by skill level where they "battle" by quickly and correctly answering multiplication, division, addition, and/or subtraction.  Our software then keeps metrics on each students skill that the teacher can access.  This takes grading pressure off of the teacher while increasing accuracy compared to paper systems as well as reduce environmental cost.

# Sprint 3
## Build Instructions:
**These build instructions assume you have python 3 and pip installed**

1. `pip install virtualenv`
2. create a new folder on your desktop
3. chage working directory to new folder
4. `virtualenv ENV`
5. `source bin/activate` if on a mac or `.Scripts/activate` for windows
6. `git clone https://github.com/Fun-Team-Name/Koeus.git`
7. `cd Koeus`
8. `pip install -r requirements.txt`

To Navigate Site:

1. `sudo ./server` to start django server and redis server for web sockets
2. in your browser go to **localhost**
3. **As Teacher** click teacher tab
4. click sign up button to create account
5. log in with credentials to navigate site





## Testing
To run unit tests:

In your terminal from the root directory og the Koeus Repo
```bash
ls
```
if manage.py is listed you are in the right place! now

run the following command:

```bash
python manage.py runserver

```
Now open a new terminal window (keep the server running in the first window!)

Navigate back to the new folder where the virtualenv ENV was created and you cloned the koeus repo

run the following commands

if on a mac

```bash
`source bin/activate`  
cd Koeus
python manage.py test teacher.tests -v 2

```
for windows
```bash
`.Scripts/activate`
cd Koeus
python manage.py test teacher.tests -v 2
```





### Acceptance Testing

#### Arena tests
To Log in as a student, You must first

1. Log in as Teacher as described above

2. Create New Room

3. Click the pencil icon next to the room you create

4. Enter first name, last name and student number

5. Click create to create a student

Now you can log in as a student **With the teacher's email address**

  1) student can navigate to arena

    * given that the student has logged in, when the arena button is clicked, they are take to an arena with the name of their class room and given their user name as an alias.

  2) student will be informed if they get a question correct

    * given that a student is in an arena, when they answer a question correctly, their score will go up by one, indicating that they got the answer correct.

14. log in with credentials navigate site

**As Student** from login page click student tab, enter student for username and student for password and navigate site

**NOTES: cookie clicker will not work unless you have docker installed. In the case docker is already installed and running,
right before step 10 do the following
`docker run -p 6379:6379 -d redis:2.8 `

now pick back up with `python manage.py runserver` and continue





please view the demo video before building:

[Build Instruction Video](https://youtu.be/NH2pk6iJvkI)

Video Notes:
In the video, some build instructions are skipped since dependencies are already installed (and docker command was already running)

## Testing
To run unit tests:

navigate to koeus-arena folder from cloned repo

run the following command:

`python manage.py test teacher -v 2`

source code is in the test.py file (/koeus/koeus-arena/teacher/test.py)

Manual Testing:

Solve multiplication problems from student page after logging in as a student
